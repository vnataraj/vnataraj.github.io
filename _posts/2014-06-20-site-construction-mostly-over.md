Phew, finally done with most of the infrastructure! The changes are small in number but in my opinion they have almost transformed the site! Now time to get back to that Node.js research...but not before watching some Kill Bill before starting work (after all, all work and no play makes for a very dull undergrad)! 

Again, if you have any comments, questions, concerns, job prospects, or any other greetings please do not hesitate to send me an email [here]({{ site.url }}/contact/).

Thanks,

Vipul

P.S: Recruiters may want to check out my [Projects]({{ site.url }}/projects/) page.  It showcases some of my projects that I have worked on (in particular, the [N.O.L.F.I.]({{ site.url }}/projects/#nolfi) project really stands out).
