So, it's been a while.  Here's some of the stuff that's been going on lately

- My team won a prize from Firebase at MHacks for our project, Jot.  Jot is a platform to crowd-source authoring of novels, which lets you vote on which author's content best fits the book at any given time.  It's a pretty cool hack, and I hope to finish it with my team some day. The application is listed [here](http://challengepost.com/software/jot).

- At Boilermake this past weekend, my team and I won the prize from Paypal/Venmo/Braintree for best use of their API.  We created a Pebble application called Paybble(get it? Pay[Pal]+[Pe]bble) that lets you send money directly to contacts from your phone's contact list.  It requires a companion application for iOS, too.  After that, it sends you and whomever you just paid, notifiying you of the transaction!  Read more at the application's [ChallengePost page](http://challengepost.com/software/paybble).
