I have been busy over the last couple of weeks with my transition to West Lafayette and figuring out logistics for courses and research, but the semester has finally started in full swing!  I am about to leave for MHacks where I hope to work on something amazing!  
  However, before I leave I just wanted to talk quickly about my Machine Learning course.  I guess I'll start off with the obvious...I'm taking a machine learning course!
I've been interested in Statistics as of late and I hope that this course is able to provide me with opportunities to apply what i've learned in the field!  
  I've just found out that our bus is about to leave, but I'll be writing another post after MHacks!
