title: Research, Project ideas and more!

Hi guys,

Today I just had my second research call(the first being a week ago).  I\'m still new to the project so I have been assigned a small introductory project to get myself familiar with the code.  I haven't used node.js before so this will be exciting! More to follow on that in the future.

It also just occured to me to create a munchkin level counter on my site along with a searchable rulebook; in case there is any ambiguity with the rules.  Or perhaps something else? We shall see what happens, I guess!

Over and out!
