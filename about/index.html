  <p>
      I am an Undergraduate student at Purdue University working on research primarily for the next semester.  I am an enthusiastic learner and love experimenting with different technologies by hacking together prototypes either at hackathons or on my own time.  For more information on some of the projects that I have done, you can see my <a href=http://www.github.com/vnataraj">GitHub</a> page.
